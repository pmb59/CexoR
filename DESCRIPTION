Description: Strand specific peak-pair calling in ChIP-exo replicates.
        The cumulative Skellam distribution function
        is used to detect significant normalised count
        differences of opposed sign at each DNA strand (peak-pairs).
        Then, irreproducible discovery rate for overlapping peak-pairs across
        biological replicates is computed.
